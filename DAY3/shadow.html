    <h1>BACK BENCHERS</h1>
    <p>
        College is not a bad home for backbenchers, as they can easily eat, sleep, and repeat. It’s not just this; they can easily brush their teeth if possible. So comfortable, right? The top-grade students take full responsibility for behaving as proper college-going students, and they keep good momentum with teachers throughout the day.
        They almost cover all the mischief of backbenchers by questioning the teachers and getting applauded for their brilliant minds. By the way, this covering is not intentional; it just happens. Of course, why will one save another who doesn’t align with their ideas? Toppers don’t really always appreciate backbenchers.        
        When teachers ask anything from the backbencher, he or she might be seen wiping their faces because they were just eating a snack or maybe snatching each other's snack. Then, they stand up with a question mark in their heads and start stuttering with, uh, um, well! Its a signal for teachers to turn over to their favorite person—I mean, a topper.
